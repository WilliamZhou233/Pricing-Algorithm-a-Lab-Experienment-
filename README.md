# Pricing-Algorithm
Collect or desigb pricing algorithms for the research of "Algorithmic Collusion"

Input:\
(1) product information regarding type, industry, market structure;\
(2) historical and current price information among competitors;
       
Output: new price that can maximize profit.

Methods:\
(1) select specific product types whose market competition concentrates on price dimension;\
(2) set different numbers of subjects to simulate different market structure;\
(3) adopte different pricing strategies referencing to literature in management science;\
(4) use different machine learning algorithms to achieve different strategies.

Goal: examine whether pricing algorithm using machine learning technology can stablize product price in the marketplace.

## Research Project: "Can Algorithm Collude? A Lab Experiment"
### Algorithm and Collusion: a scenario typology

### Dataset
Mainstream e-commerce platforms open their API for massive data retrieval. \
eg. Taobao API: https://open.taobao.com/api.htm?docId=46&docType=2; \
JD API: https://jos.jd.com/apilist; \
Amazon API: https://aws.amazon.com/cn/api-gateway/; \
Comprehensive E-commerce data service provider: Onebound（万邦）https://open.onebound.cn/.

By accessing to different e-commerce platforms API, I'm planing to retrieve around 100,000 data points comprised of product type, industry, price, volomn, seller, timestamp, etc.

\* Buyer's information will not be collected because it's not the concern for my research. So, there will be no problem of research ethics involving human.

### Research Approach
Lab Experiment: examine the potential of algorithmic collusion by using advanced AI algorithms like deep-learning.

Field investigation: interview algorithm engineers in IT industries to know whether there are industry-wide use of AI pricing algorithms.
