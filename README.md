# Pricing-Algorithm
Collecting or Creating pricing algorithms for the research of "Algorithmic Collusion"

Input: product data regarding current price, competitor's price, volumn, cost, time, etc.

Output: new price that may maximize profits.

### Dataset
Plan: retrieve various platforms' data about product type, price, volomn, timestamp, etc.

### Method
Lab Experiment: examine the potential of algorithmic collusion by using advanced AI algorithms like deep-learning.

Field investigation: interview algorithm engineers in IT industries to know whether there are industry-wide use of AI pricing algorithms.
